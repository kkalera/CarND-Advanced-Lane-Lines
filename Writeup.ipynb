    "# Project: Advanced lane finding\n",
    "In this project we are challenged to improve the on the first lane finding project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given images and photo's, taken from a camera in the center of a car. From those images and videos, we need to find the lane we are in. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code can be found here: https://github.com/kkalera/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/Untitled.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's take a look at the steps we take.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to take:\n",
    "- Camera calibration\n",
    "- Apply calibration to images\n",
    "- Use color calibration, sobel, gradient, etc to get a binary image\n",
    "- Transform the image to a birds eye view\n",
    "- Detect the pixels that make up the lane\n",
    "- Calculate the curvature of the lane\n",
    "- Calculate the vehicle's position in respect to the center of the lane\n",
    "- Transform the detected lane back to the camera's perspective\n",
    "- Overlay the lane on the image, show the lane curvature and show how far off center the vehicle is\n",
    "- Test the pipeline on video's"
